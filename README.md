# My-First-Web-Page

In March, I started using Free Code Camp (FCC) to learn how to code and for the first project, the requirement is to build a tribute page 
on CodePen.io, similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/NNvBQW/.

For the project, I built a tribute page to Grace Jones: http://codepen.io/willruz/full/NNopyJ/
